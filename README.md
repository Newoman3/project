This repo contains the source code for a simple CRUD application, written in Go. The application uses [GORM](https://gorm.io/) to connect to and communicate with an existing [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb-gorm.html).
